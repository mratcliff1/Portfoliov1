# Portfoliov1

literally just my first portfolio.

The goal is to put an icon for linkedin, github, and a placeholder for something else like Ko-fi or patreon or something and make them clickable. This should't be too difficult.

Also, put a picture of myself with a spot for my resume to go.

The color palet will first be number 9 on https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/ just to begin testing out how to use them.
